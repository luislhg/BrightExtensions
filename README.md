### _(BETA)_ Bright Git

**BrightGit** provides a set of features to streamline daily VS/Git operations and Entity Framework (EF) migrations within Visual Studio. It includes the following features:

- **Auto Apply EF Migrations**: Automatically detects and applies EF migrations _(if any)_ when changing branches.
- **Auto Save/Restore Tabs**: Saves and restores all open tabs when switching branches, preserving the context of each branch/issue.

**BrightGit:** This is still in beta and can only be installed via local release at this moment

## Roadmap / FAQ

The roadmap is subject to change based on feedback and development progress.

- Several tweaks and QoL improvements are dependent on the new Visual Studio 2022 API.
- Save/Restore Tabs should be more sophisticated, with a window for manual tab handling.
- BrightGit could eventually be renamed to BrightVS (includes everything that most .NET developers use).
- Adding common templates for items and projects is under consideration.
- A third extension to the suite is under consideration.

---
## Principles guiding this project
- Developers should focus on bringing ideas to life and not on repetitive tasks.
- Extension won't do things that Visual Studio can already do.
- Extension only uses the new Extensibility API (out-of-proc).
- Extension only supports projects .NET 6.0 and above.
- Extension should only perform fast and snap actions.
- Extension should be easy to use and/or integrate with Visual Studio workflow.
- Everything that is generated (output) should be standard or EASILY configurable.
